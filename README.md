# slidev-monorepo

A template for a Turborepo with multiple slidev presentations that share dependencies.

You can also run the command from the root directoryâ€”Turborepo will start the dev servers of all talks. Make sure to use different ports. `talk1` and `talk2` run on ports `3030` and `3040` by default.
