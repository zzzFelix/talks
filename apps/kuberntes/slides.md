# How to Blow Up a Kuberntes Cluster

## Resource Management for Pods and Containers

---

# Know your resources

The amount of resources available to Pods is less than the node capacity because system daemons use a portion of the available resources. Within the Kubernetes API, each Node has a .status.allocatable field (see NodeStatus for details).

--- 

# Nodes use more memory than allowed

Total limits may be over 100 percent, i.e., overcommitted.

--- 

# Watch out for namespace limits

Note: A LimitRange does not check the consistency of the default values it applies. This means that a default value for the limit that is set by LimitRange may be less than the request value specified for the container in the spec that a client submits to the API server. If that happens, the final Pod will not be scheduleable. See Constraints on resource limits and requests for more details.

# Watch out for namespace limits

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: cpu-resource-constraint
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      cpu: 500m
    type: Container
```
