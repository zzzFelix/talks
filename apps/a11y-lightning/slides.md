# Inclusive design

<!--
Inclusive Design = Instead of designing a product and then figuring out how it might work for people with disabilities, we design a product that works for everyone, including people with disabilities.

Let's assume we do this and everything else that's in WCAG
Leaves us with the Why? Why should we care? Because it's the right thing to do. It is. But that has never convinced anyone.
